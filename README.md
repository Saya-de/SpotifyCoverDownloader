# SpotifyCoverDownloader
This is a simple tool to download the best quality Spotify track and playlist images without using the API.
This was thrown together within a few minutes, which is why I use the HTML Agility Pack out of laziness. If you find trash code, keep it to yourself because I don't care.

If you want to use it, remember to put the "HtmlAgilityPack.NetCore.dll" into the same folder as the "SpotifyCoverDL.exe" or it wont work. The image gets saved in the same folder as the .exe.
